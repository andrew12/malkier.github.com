# Malkieri History #

Okay, this is my best attempt at recalling the total history of Malkier,
`#malkier`, and everyone in-between. The dates are probably way off in some
(most) cases, and dead on in others. If you remember something differently,
feel free to email me corrections.

## A Few Notes ##

Don't accept dates in this as 100% fact. They'll probably change after a few
people get a good look at them. People with a better memory than me.

Dates in this document take the form MMM DD YYYY (eg: Nov 11 2004). This
appears to be the only semi-international format.

Most of the events before 2002 happened on `irc.scifi.com`. This place ran a
hacked-up version of IRC and the server software contained many, many exploits.
Most of which were found by members of `#malkier`. They never got fixed, so we
left. This server also had little (zero) administration. This meant that the
toughest person on the server was the toughest person, period. It was really
rather tribal, actually.

The "services" and "stats" programs mentioned before 2004 are probably
Cygnus IRC Services and OperStats. Both were originally written by **skold**
and I later ported them to TS5.

## Terminology ##

* IRC -- Internet Relay Chat. A real-time chat medium that predates all of the
  instant messaging networks and postdates bulletin board systems.

* XMPP -- Extensible Messsaging and Presence Protocol. Commonly known as Jabber,
  XMPP is a real-time chat medium that vastly improves upon both IM and IRC.

* DoS -- Denial of Service. An act that generally exploits a known problem in
  server software to disrupt its function.

* DDoS -- Distributed Denial of Serivice. An act where several hundred (or even
  thousand) computers are remotely controlled by a single person or a small
  group of people for the sole purpose of flooding a servers bandwidth to the
  point where it is unreachable.

* Flooding -- on IRC: an act that causes a client's SendQ to exceed its limit
  and disconnect the client from the server.
