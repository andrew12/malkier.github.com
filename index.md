# About Malkier #

The name "Malkier" was created by Robert Jordan in his book series entitled
"The Wheel of Time." In the literature, Malkier was a country that fell to the
Bad Guys. A lot of people from `#malkier` have read this series, so we named it
that. We actually have very little, if anything at all to do with this
literature.

Our Malkier is much different. For the most part, Malkier is a group of people
who have been friends for a long time, and been through interesting experiences
together. We've often lost each other for months and even years only to
eventually pop up, usually in `#malkier`. We used IRC as a meeting place for many
years, but most of us also know each other through email, IM, telephone, and even real life. However, for the most part, we know each other only as text.

## A Brief History ##

Sometime in late 1999, the friends that now make up `#malkier` began to form a
group. I, **rakaur**, was introduced to **Scorpwanna** and **joft** on IRC, and
we formed a channel called `#TwiNET`. **Guyver** joined up shortly after.
I went offline for a while, and `#TwiNET` died.

Meanwhile, **rintaun** and **tanka** formed a channel called `#ProjectXero`.
When I came back on IRC, he reformed the members of `#TwiNET` into
a channel named `#Aiur` (the Protoss homeworld in StarCraft).  I met up with
**madragoran** around this time, and we all started going to `#AesSedai`
(another name from "The Wheel of Time," referring to an elite group of mystics).
**joft**'s channel was still around, and we decided to merge them and call it
`#malkier`. I met up with **rintaun** and we merged `#ProjectXero` into
`#malkier`.

We left that server eventually, and went to another. After a while we started
our own IRC network, with the help of **naki**. It lasted a few years but never
really accomplished anything. Leaving the first server, even though it later
self-destructed, proved to be the killing blow. Many of the members left, and
even fewer survive now. The ones that have stayed with us through the IRC
network ordeal are pretty much never around anyway.

We've gone from being an IRC channel, to a server, to a network, back to a
channel, and now onto more.

We have a [more detailed history][history] on this site.
